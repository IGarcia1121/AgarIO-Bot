# Petri
Custom Agar.IO client made in C# built using SwinGame (www.swingame.com) for a 24-hour Hackathon.

Stil very buggy - refining will be done later!

##Controls:

*Click to move to a specific location.

*Hold the mouse button for Agar.io-like movement

*Press space to split

*Press W to eject some mass

##Known issues:

*Grid is messed up

*No scaling as you get bigger

*Text positioning is bad

*Very choppy compared to website due to no interpolation

*Sometimes blobs will not despawn
